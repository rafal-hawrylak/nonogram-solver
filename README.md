Backlog:
- [done] framework to run plugins
- [done] fix failing/disabled tests
- [done] fix TheBiggestFirstOrLastSubGapFitsOnlyTheBiggestFirstOrLastNumber
- [done] skip solved rows and cols
- [done] implement filling the gap if the only matching
- [done] bug in FillTheNumbersWithStartAndEndNotConnectedSolver
- areSubGapsMergeable may check if in the same gap - do not remember why is this check needed?
- solve SolveWholeCase017Test - deterministic - iteration = 111 - completion 77% (466 / 600)
- solve SolveWholeCase020Test - deterministic - iteration = 77 - completion 30% (269 / 875)
